# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync Android Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Expo's `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` API on certain Android devices. While the API call might appear successful, the browser may fail to open correctly.  The bug's root cause is likely related to variations in Android device configurations and custom ROMs. This repo provides a minimal reproducible example and a potential workaround.

## Bug Report

The primary issue is the unpredictable behavior of `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` on Android. In some cases, despite seemingly successful execution and a positive response from the API, the default browser fails to launch or display the requested URL. This inconsistency makes debugging challenging.  The provided `bug.js` illustrates the problem.

## Solution

The included `bugSolution.js` provides a possible solution involving checking for a specific error code and using a fallback mechanism. This approach involves using the `Linking` API as a backup if `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` fails in an unexpected way.   Further refinement may be necessary depending on your specific needs and the Android devices you need to support.
